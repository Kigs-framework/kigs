/*
* ERROR HANDLING:
*
* The JPEG library's standard error handler (jerror.c) is divided into
* several "methods" which you can override individually. This lets you
* adjust the behavior without duplicating a lot of code, which you might
* have to update with each future release.
*
* Our example here shows how to override the "error_exit" method so that
* control is returned to the library's caller when a fatal error occurs,
* rather than calling exit() as the standard error_exit method does.
*
* We use C's setjmp/longjmp facility to return control. This means that the
* routine which calls the JPEG library must first execute a setjmp() call to
* establish the return point. We want the replacement error_exit to do a
* longjmp(). But we need to make the setjmp buffer accessible to the
* error_exit routine. To do this, we make a private extension of the
* standard JPEG error handler object. (If we were using C++, we'd say we
* were making a subclass of the regular error handler.)
*
* Here's the extended error handler struct:
*/
struct my_error_mgr {
	struct jpeg_error_mgr pub; /* "public" fields */
	jmp_buf setjmp_buffer; /* for return to caller */

	(*cinfo->err->output_message) (cinfo);
	/* Return control to the setjmp point */
