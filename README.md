# kigs framework

Kigs framework is a C++ modular multipurpose cross platform framework.
Assoria used it as a basis for many projects.
The main goal was to be able to develop different types of applications (games, simulators, viewers...) quickly,
in a totally independent manner (without any "black box"). 

We decided to first open source the framework for Windows ( x86 , x64 , for openGL and D3D, WUP D3D ), and HTML5 (Emscripten) platforms. 
Other platforms ( iOS, Android, Linux... ) are still private but could also be opened in the future.

The main IDE to build current platforms is Visual Studio C++ 2019.
