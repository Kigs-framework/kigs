Kigs framework is a C++ modular multi-purpose cross-platform framework.
Assoria used it as a basis for [many projects](https://kigs-framework.org/Projects).

The main goal was to be able to develop different types of applications (games, simulators, viewers...) quickly,
in a totally independent manner.
