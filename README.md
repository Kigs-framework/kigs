Kigs framework is a C++ modular multi-purpose cross-platform framework.
It was used as a basis for [many professionnal projects](https://kigs-framework.org/Projects).

The main goal was to be able to develop different types of applications (games, simulators, viewers...) quickly,
in a totally independent manner. 

Kigs framework can be seen as a "game engine", but more general purpose and more open and scalable. 

Released platforms are : 
* Windows ( x86 , x64 , for openGL and D3D, WUP D3D ) using Microsoft Visual Studio.
* HTML5 (Emscripten) (Online compiled samples are [here](https://kigs-framework.org/Samples)).
* Android using Microsoft Visual Studio. (help welcome to set up Android Studio build).
* iOS in "as is" state : The platform has not been maintained for more than a year (help welcome to set up XCode build).
* help welcome to improve existing platforms or add new ones ( Linux, MacOS )


The main IDE to build current platforms is Visual Studio C++ 2019.
